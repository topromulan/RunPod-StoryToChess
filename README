RunPod-StoryToChess by Dale Anderson

Build the Dockerfile in the handler subdirectory and push it. Or use dockermccoy/runpod:chess_analogy_handler

To run it locally, 
 - Export your RunPod API key as MY_RUNPOD_API_KEY.
 - Run the client ChessStory.sh at that same command line.
 - With no arguments, it will ask you to write a story and return your story ID.
 - To read the chess interpretation of your story, supply the story ID as an argument.

To test handler on the local machine, install ollama and the same dependencies as the continer, then try:
 - python3.exe chess_analogy_handler.sh --test_input='{"input":{"story":"A chocolate cow makes way to a new pasture and strawberry flavor."}}'

To use the hosted instance on RunPod, use the bash client like this:
 - To write a new story and get the Story ID: client/ChessStory.sh
 - To get the generated text for your Story ID: client/ChessStory.sh <Story ID>

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Cold start may take up to a minute or longer. Status 12/18/2024: Working on it; it is due to ollama pulling the model. This should be fixed soon by storing the model on a persistent volume, or acquiring it during the docker build.
