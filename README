RunPod-StoryToChess by Dale Anderson

Build the Dockerfile in the handler subdirectory and push it. Or use dockermccoy/runpod:chess_analogy_handler

Export your RunPod API key as MY_API_KEY.

Run the client ChessStory.sh at that same command line.

With no arguments, it will ask you to write a story and return your story ID.

To read the chess interpretation of your story, supply the story ID as an argument.

To test handler on the local machine, try:
 - python3.exe chess_analogy_handler.sh --test_input='{"input":{"story":"A chocolate cow makes way to a new pasture and strawberry flavor."}}'
